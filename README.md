# Landscape Postcard

This project was created in 2020 (but uploaded 4 years later). It is an improvement of the [plant generator](https://pleaseworkplant.azurewebsites.net/).
I stopped working on it because got OutOfMemoryException when started adding plants to the landscape

# Functions
1. Creating plants (with gradient flowers! This feature is missing in the web build of plant generator, because SVGLib didn't support it)

2. Creating Delaunay triangulation (landscape with different heights)
